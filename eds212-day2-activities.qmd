### Attached tidyverse & palmerpenguins

Find the derivative expression & slope at indicated value for each function below:

$f(x) = x^2$ at x=3

```{r}
exp_1 <- expression(x^2)
deriv_1 <- D(expr = exp_1, name = "x")

# evaluate at x = 3
x <- 3
eval(deriv_1)
```

Meaning: For this function, at x = 3, the slope is 6

```{r}
exp_2 <- expression(2* (3 * a + 2 )^4 - 5)
deriv_2 <- D(expr = exp_2, name = "a")

# evaluate at a = 1.2
a <- 1.2
eval(deriv_2)
```
